# Query-wellformedness Dataset

25,100 queries from the Paralex corpus (Fader et al., 2013) annotated with human ratings of whether they are well-formed natural language questions.

## Description

Google's query wellformedness dataset was created by crowdsourcing well-formedness annotations for 25,100 queries from the Paralex corpus. Every query was annotated by five raters each with 1/0 rating of whether or not the query is well-formed.
